# Braille-Box
🛠️ Work in progress - Building a dual-mode Braille input/output device for visually impaired users.
## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Braille Box** is an ongoing hardware-software project aimed at empowering visually impaired users with a low-cost, portable assistive device. Built using a Raspberry Pi and basic electronic components, the system enables **dual-mode Braille interaction**:

- 📝 **Writing Mode** – Users can type Braille using 6 tactile input buttons. Each Braille character is recognized, spoken out loud via text-to-speech, and optionally saved to a file.
- 📖 **Reading Mode** – The device physically raises Braille dots using solenoids or actuators to display saved content, allowing the user to read it through touch.

The device also includes features like:
- A **toggle switch** to change between modes.
- **Audio output (TTS)** for spoken feedback using `espeak`.
- Option for **silent/exam mode** with all audio disabled.
- Plans for **USB export** and **offline usage**, making it usable in examination scenarios.

This project is currently in its **prototyping phase**, and documentation, circuit diagrams, and code will be added as the system evolves.
